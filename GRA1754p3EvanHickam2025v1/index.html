		<p>By virtue of having some of the darkest night skies in the contiguous United States, Terlingua, Texas has become a mecca for astronomy enthusiasts in the area and from abroad.  Our club meets twice per month out in the open desert to take in the amazing sights that float above us every night.  We have the privilege to have Sull Ross University Astronomy professor John B. Ulysses as a club member.  He is an invaluable resource to have as we observe the night sky and questions spring to mind.  Also in our membership, we have veteran astonomy photography, Geraldine Clicks, always on had to give you pointers on how to capture amazing images of the stars and heavenly bodies that can only be seen from our vantage point here in Terlingua.  At our club events you will meet these and other enthusiastic astronomers and photographers.  We do provide some high-powered binoculars and telescopes but members are encouraged to bring their own cameras and laptops.  There will be a mini-meetup just before sundown at the Bad Rabbit Cafe for anyone wanting to grab a bite before the starts come out.  We look forward to meeting and hanging out with you in our shared love of astronomy and astro-photography that can only be found here in Terlingua!
