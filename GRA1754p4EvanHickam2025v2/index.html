<h1>Jimmy Jet and His TV Set</h1>
		<h2>By Shel Silverstein</h2>
		
<p>I'll tell you the story of Jimmy Jet--</p>
<p>And you know what I tell you is true.</p>
<p>He loved to watch his TV set</p>
<p>Almost as much as you.</p>

<p class="two" >He watched all day, he watched all night</p>
<p class="two" >Till he grew pale and lean,</p>
<p class="two" >From 'The Early Show' to 'The Late Show'</p>
<p class="two" >And all the shows in between.</p>

<p class="three" >He watched till his eyes were frozen wide,</p>
<p class="three">And his bottom grew into his chair.</p>
<p class="three">And his chin turned into a tuning dial,</p>
<p class="three">And antennae grew out of his hair.</p>

<p class="four">And his brains turned into TV tubes,</p>
<p class="four">And his face to a TV screen.</p>
<p class="four">And two knobs saying 'vert.' and 'horiz.'</p>
<p class="four">Grew where his ears had been.</p>

<p class="five">And he grew a plug that looked like a tail</p>
<p class="five">So we plugged in little Jim.</p>
<p class="five">And now instead of him watching TV</p>
<p class="five">We all sit around and watch him.</p>
